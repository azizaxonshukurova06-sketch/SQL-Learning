5. In SQL, the DROP command removes a table from the database, DELETE removes records from a table, and TRUNCATE removes all rows from a table.
The delete statement is an SQL command used to remove one or more rows from a table based on a specific condition. It is a DML (data manipulation command). This command allows us to remove unwanted or obsolete data from a database and can be used to delete single rows.
Unwanted or obsolete data refers to data that is no longer needed or useful but they do take up space in the Database for example incorrect, duplicated, or outdated data.
The DROP statement in SQL allows us to remove an entire table, along with all its data, indexes and triggers from the database. Once executed, the table and its data are permanently deleted.
A trigger is a special type of program that is stored in the databaseâ€™s memory and has a unique name. This program automatically runs when something happens in a database, like when an existing row is changed or when a new row is added.
This statement allows us to remove all the data from the table by maintaining the table structure. The Truncate statement can be rolled back using the ROLLBACK statement. It is much faster than the DELETE statement. But it cannot remove specific rows based on a condition.
